# Optimized For Search Engines

## AS A MARKETING AGENCY
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

- **lead Generation** : Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.
- **Brand Awareness** : Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility for your business.
- **Cost Management** : As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.

## Usage

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

* WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
