# Optimized For Search Engines

## AS A MARKETING AGENCY
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

- **lead Generation** : Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.
- **Brand Awareness** : Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility for your business.
- **Cost Management** : As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
